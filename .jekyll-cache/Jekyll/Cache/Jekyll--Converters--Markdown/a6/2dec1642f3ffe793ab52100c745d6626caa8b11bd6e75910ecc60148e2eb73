I"j<p>Hi,<br /><br />A few months ago I discovered this new stuff called coffee script, and thought to myself, “this is awesome I’ll write less and do more” Today, I tried to continue a development of a pretty fat client side and tried to find myself in the 1000 lines of code I wrote so far (not so many). It was pretty hard, and I’m the only programmer for now, can’t imagine how a new programmer would enter to this project.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">So…</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">coffee-script is </span><span style="background-color: white;">java-script that look better, no other benefits, and if you plan to write a little more than 200 lines of code, consider using some strongly typed language(that can generate debugable java script) with good IDE that’ll help you maintain your code. </span></p>

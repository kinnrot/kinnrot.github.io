I"`<p>Let’s say you have a vey important procedure that takes a while, and you need to process it in background, but you still want to execute ASAP.<br /><br />I’m using Delayed Job on Heroku, and could not find a lot of tutorials to do this simple task.<br /><br />So here is the simplest way to achieve this ability, you can raise a process/deamon  that will have only one queue to work on. (Dealyed job worker by default is queue agnostic, just process all jobs)<br /><br />In procfile:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;urgentworker:  QUEUE=urgent bundle exec rake jobs:work&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />You can call the worker in any name you want and even define multiple workers for multiple queues.<br />And in the “urgent” job just define the queue name to be “urgent” the worker will process only jobs in this queue.<br /><br />example:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;handle_asynchronously :some_job, :queue =&gt; “urgent’&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />This will also work for Resque.<br /><br />Notice that for rescue you can write QUEUE=* <b>but for delayed job you can’t.</b></p>

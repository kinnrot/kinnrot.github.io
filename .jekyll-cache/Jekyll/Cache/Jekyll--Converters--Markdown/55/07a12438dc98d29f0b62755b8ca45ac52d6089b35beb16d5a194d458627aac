I"<p>I found it very annoying that php data to excel is not so straight forward as one might think <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15699301/export-mysql-data-to-excel-in-php">,lots of wrong stuff</a> here.<br /><br />The thing is, as a developer you don’t know a lot about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">encoding</a>.<br /><br />So you don’t really think about it until you have bugs, than you start searching for a better solution, I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3466065/67505">this</a>.<br /><br />Meaning you manually convert encoding to support excel, and add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM</a>.<br /><br />Just wanted to gather a few links together for future use.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br /><br /></p>

I"š<p>I needed to choose WordPress hosting service for some of clients and decided to do some research to figure out whatâ€™s best value for each client needs.</p>

<p>There are many service providers in this area, After lots of googling I decided to focus on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://wordpress.com/create/?aff=9716&amp;cid=958799">WordPress</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/kinnrot/">BlueHost</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://kinsta.com/?utm_source=kinnrot.github.io">Kinsta</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re building a new site/blog without any technical knowledge, <a href="https://wordpress.com/create/?aff=9716&amp;cid=958799">WordPress</a> is the right place for you,
owned by the official word press organization offering limited capabilities cheap plans, and more expensive plans with
more options like upload a custom theme, and charging money via paypal.</p>

<p>They also got a free plan, but you wonâ€™t get to use your own domain name.</p>

<h2 id="bluehost">BlueHost</h2>
<p>This is the most economy wise solution.</p>

<p>If you have technical knowledge and you have a custom theme, and wanna save money, this is the service for you, 
Itâ€™s a managed solution with one click WordPress install. <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/kinnrot/">BlueHost</a> also offers additional services like seo optimization tool, and backup tool for additional cost.</p>

<h2 id="kinsta">Kinsta</h2>

I"ö<p>If you ever used any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> framework, Iâ€™m sure you asked yourself more than once, â€˜Where should I put this piece of code?â€™ (If not thatâ€™s also fine).
Well, there is no one answer for all problems but, I asked it a lot.</p>

<p>In this post, Iâ€™m gonna focus about the view part.</p>

<p>View objects, AKA view models, but any other name is fine (presenter view object, view controller mediator, whatever).</p>

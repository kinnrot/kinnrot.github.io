[{"content":"The world of AI agents is exploding, and while frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen have been dominating the conversation, there\u0026rsquo;s a new player in town that\u0026rsquo;s worth your attention: Strands Agents.\nStrands Agents is an open-source framework developed by AWS, designed to help developers build production-ready, multi-agent AI systems with minimal code. Unlike some heavier frameworks, Strands focuses on providing simple primitives for complex orchestration patterns like handoffs, swarms, and graph workflows.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through what makes Strands special and how to get your first agent running in minutes.\nWhy Strands Agents? While you can build agents with just raw LLM calls, things get messy quickly when you need multiple agents to coordinate. Strands solves this by offering:\nModel-Driven Orchestration: Agents decide how to interact based on the model\u0026rsquo;s reasoning capabilities. Model Agnostic: While it integrates seamlessly with Amazon Bedrock, it supports other providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Type Safety: If you are using the TypeScript SDK, you get first-class type support. The Python SDK is equally robust. Installation Getting started is straightforward. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the Python SDK for this guide.\nFirst, ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then, install the core package and standard tools:\npip install strands-agents strands-agents-tools Your First Agent: Hello World Let\u0026rsquo;s build a simple agent that can perform a basic task. We\u0026rsquo;ll define a tool and give it to an agent.\nCreate a file named agent.py:\nfrom strands import Agent, tool # 1. Define a tool @tool def word_count(text: str) -\u0026gt; int: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Count words in text. Useful for checking length constraints.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return len(text.split()) # 2. Initialize the Agent # Note: Ensure you have your AWS credentials or other provider API keys configured. # By default, Strands looks for Amazon Bedrock configuration. agent = Agent( name=\u0026#34;Editor\u0026#34;, instructions=\u0026#34;You are a helpful editor. Use tools to analyze text.\u0026#34;, tools=[word_count] ) # 3. Run the agent response = agent(\u0026#34;How many words are in this sentence?\u0026#34;) print(response) Running the Code Before running the script, make sure you have your model provider configured. If you are using AWS Bedrock (the default), you\u0026rsquo;ll need standard AWS credentials set up in your environment.\npython agent.py The agent will analyze your prompt, realize it needs to count words, call the word_count tool, and return the result naturally.\nNext Steps This is just the tip of the iceberg. Strands Agents really shines when you have multiple agents interacting—for example, a \u0026ldquo;Researcher\u0026rdquo; agent handing off findings to a \u0026ldquo;Writer\u0026rdquo; agent.\nIf you are looking to build scalable AI systems on AWS, Strands is definitely a framework to keep on your radar.\nCheck out the official documentation for more advanced patterns and examples.\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/getting-started-with-strands-agents/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe world of AI agents is exploding, and while frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen have been dominating the conversation, there\u0026rsquo;s a new player in town that\u0026rsquo;s worth your attention: \u003cstrong\u003eStrands Agents\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrands Agents is an open-source framework developed by AWS, designed to help developers build production-ready, multi-agent AI systems with minimal code.

Launching the Instance Log in to the AWS Console. Navigate to EC2 -\u0026gt; Launch Instance. Name: OpenClaw-Agent-01. AMI: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type. Instance Type: t3.small. Why? The t3.micro only has 1GB RAM, which can be tight. t3.small gives you 2GB RAM and 2 vCPUs, which is much safer for production. Key Pair: Create a new key pair (openclaw-key) and download the .pem file. 2. Security Groups (The Firewall) AWS blocks everything by default. You need to open ports.\nCreate a security group. Allow SSH (Port 22) from My IP. If OpenClaw has a web interface you want to access, allow HTTP (80) or the specific port (e.g., 3000) from your IP. 3. Connecting Move your key to a secure folder and change permissions:\nchmod 400 openclaw-key.pem ssh -i \u0026#34;openclaw-key.pem\u0026#34; ubuntu@\u0026lt;your-ec2-public-dns\u0026gt; 4. Installation The standard installation applies here.\nsudo apt update sudo apt install git -y # Install Node.js curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - sudo apt install -y nodejs # Clone OpenClaw git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git cd openclaw npm install 5. Integration with AWS Services The real power of using AWS is integration. You can configure OpenClaw to save its logs or \u0026ldquo;memories\u0026rdquo; directly to an S3 bucket instead of the local disk.\nTo do this:\nCreate an IAM Role with AmazonS3FullAccess (or a more scoped policy). Attach this IAM Role to your EC2 instance. Install the AWS SDK in your OpenClaw project (npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3) if you are writing custom plugins. By running on AWS, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to scale from one agent to a thousand.\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/enterprise-openclaw-aws-ec2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor many, \u003cstrong\u003eAWS\u003c/strong\u003e is synonymous with \u0026ldquo;cloud.\u0026rdquo; If you are building a serious business around your AI agents, or if you simply want to integrate \u003cstrong\u003eOpenClaw\u003c/strong\u003e with other AWS services like S3 (for storage) or Lambda (for serverless functions), running on EC2 is the logical step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is how to deploy OpenClaw on an Amazon EC2 instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-launching-the-instance\"\u003e1.

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s managing your WhatsApp messages while you sleep or executing long-running web automations, a cloud VPS is the way to go.\nAfter testing various providers, here are the top 5 ways to run OpenClaw in the cloud right now.\n1. DigitalOcean: The Reliable Choice DigitalOcean remains the favorite for many developers. Their \u0026ldquo;Droplets\u0026rdquo; are incredibly easy to set up, and their documentation is second to none. For OpenClaw, a basic 2GB RAM droplet is usually enough to keep things snappy.\nBest for: Beginners and those who want a \u0026ldquo;set it and forget it\u0026rdquo; experience. Link: DigitalOcean 2. Vultr: Global Performance Vultr offers an impressive array of locations. If you need your OpenClaw agent to have low latency to a specific region, Vultr is likely your best bet. Their high-frequency compute instances are overkill for OpenClaw but make the web browsing features feel instantaneous.\nBest for: Users needing specific geographic locations. Link: Vultr 3. Hetzner: The Value King If you are in Europe or the US and want the most \u0026ldquo;bang for your buck,\u0026rdquo; Hetzner is unbeatable. Their ARM64 cloud instances are dirt cheap and perform remarkably well with OpenClaw’s Node-based architecture.\nBest for: Budget-conscious power users. Link: Hetzner 4. Linode (Akamai): The Developer\u0026rsquo;s Choice Now part of Akamai, Linode continues to offer stellar support and reliable hardware. Their CLI tool makes deploying OpenClaw instances across multiple regions a breeze for those who love the terminal.\nBest for: Developers who prefer a clean, no-nonsense interface. Link: Linode 5. AWS: Enterprise-Grade Scalability For those who want to integrate OpenClaw into a larger ecosystem, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the natural choice. Using an EC2 t3.small instance gives you access to the entire AWS suite of tools for monitoring and scaling.\nBest for: Users who already live in the AWS ecosystem. Link: AWS How to choose? If you\u0026rsquo;re just starting, go with DigitalOcean. If you want the cheapest reliable option, Hetzner is your friend.\nRegardless of which one you pick, getting OpenClaw off your local machine and into the cloud is the first step toward true AI autonomy.\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/run-openclaw-cloud-2026/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been following the AI agent space lately, you know that \u003cstrong\u003eOpenClaw\u003c/strong\u003e (the project formerly known as Clawdbot and briefly Moltbot) has become the gold standard for self-hosted autonomous assistants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile running it on your local machine is great for testing, the real power of OpenClaw comes when it\u0026rsquo;s running 24/7 in the cloud.

You probably won\u0026rsquo;t learn anything from this task, but that\u0026rsquo;s the job, and this is what the future looks in this team. I trust you so little I must personally make sure you did it right, so I must review your code.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, as you can see I took it to the extreme, but even if 5% of this thoughts will pop in the employee\u0026rsquo;s mind, it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\nComplete freedom \u0026quot; We\u0026rsquo;re paying too much to our logging storage service \u0026quot;\nThis approach is wide open. no what, when or how, only why. This can go down in one or 2 ways:\nwhen it\u0026rsquo;s a junior developer:\n\u0026ldquo;Ohh sh*t I\u0026rsquo;m clueless, I have no idea what needs to be done, I\u0026rsquo;m too shy to ask anyone anything, this is scary. Why is there no one to guide me?\u0026rdquo;\nwhen it\u0026rsquo;s a senior developer:\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a problem, let\u0026rsquo;s solve it. I feel trusted and empowered by my manager to solve problems on my own\u0026rdquo;\n*There\u0026rsquo;s an even higher degree of freedom, one where you don\u0026rsquo;t focus the employee on a specific problem, and let them choose it on their own. This is not an industry standard so I\u0026rsquo;m ignoring it.\nSo, to the point, freedom is awesome, not for everyone and should be dosed right. You\u0026rsquo;re optimizing for independent team members who can do everything. in order to get there, you need to trust them and have high expectations from each team member.\nWith experienced developers it should be relatively easy, just focus on the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and they\u0026rsquo;ll figure out the rest, or ask nudging questions to get more of the \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo;. if it\u0026rsquo;s a feature, a product manager will provide the what. When you focus on the why, you create a strong ownership of the problem. This is good because you never want to get attached to a particular solution, the solution might change tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s a fast moving world. However, the problem probably won\u0026rsquo;t change so quickly. When you focus on the why, you give a wider perspective, allowing people to be more creative when it comes to proposing creative solutions. They need to think, and this is exactly why they came to work, and that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s so motivating.\nWith less experienced developers, it might be a bit trickier: you want to do the same without getting their frustration level above the tipping point where they feel incapable. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to do some sensing for each task to understand the proper level of freedom that can be given.\nMy recommendation is to start with the why, and start an open discussion about the next steps.

The faster you iterate, the faster you\u0026rsquo;ll get to your target.\nHow fast can this be done? It depends on so many things, lets try to focus on the dev part, suppose the product is a ninja with an endless queue of things he wants the R\u0026amp;D department to execute, what does it take? what kind of feedback loop do we need as developers?\nThe simplest way to explain what need to be done: \u0026ldquo;Write the correct code, according to product spec, put it on production.\u0026rdquo;\nWriting the correct code - takes time and that\u0026rsquo;s fine, what kind of feedback loop do we have when writing code?\nIt starts with a developer coding on his IDE, gets immediate feedback from it, auto lint/compile issue/warnings etc. This is the most basic and immediate feedback out there, and it should be seamlessly fast (as fast as typing)\nSecond layer of feedback are unit tests, fastest way to run your new code, in a neutral environment allowing to identify and fix issues quickly. This is less basic and immediate, but, an optimal developer experience, allow changing code, running tests almost instantly get results and iterate. In a world of SOA/Micro-services and remote dev environment, this might not be so fast, but it should. Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example, company with 200 great developers, each one constantly coding amazing things, writing tests to make sure their code works, after each test written, developer need to wait 30sec to see the test results, lets say each developer write 20 tests a day. 20X30X200=120K seconds = 33.3 hours, meaning every day, almost 2% of productivity go\u0026rsquo;s on waiting for tests to run. let\u0026rsquo;s continue to the next loop.\nThird layer - running the real product on dev env, mandatory for engineers who make user experience, how much time does it take to make an html/css/js change and see it reflects on the app? it should be instant, if it\u0026rsquo;s 30 sec, we lost another 2% for the waiting, how much time does it take to spin the env? is it fast? stable?\nNote - each time a developer need to wait more then 1 second, she might lose her focus to something else, which is a multiplier for the waiting time, not to mention the frustration when things doesn\u0026rsquo;t work locally.\nForth layer - Pull request, this is an async process, which by definition gets everything stuck, and a time to work on something else. If we need to move super fast, this process should be synchronized, and conducted f2f right after the pr was created, this is also an iterative process, get comment, fix them, re review.\nFifth layer - QA, Again async process, we wanna get here as ready as possible, to avoid another loop, cause cycles are slow here.\nWe just went over 5 layers of feedback loop, from the fastest to slowest. now think about it this way, the more iterations we do on the fast layers (1,2,3) the less chances we\u0026rsquo;ll have many iterations on the slow layers (4-5). To encourage developers to do more iterations, we need a strong infra to allow developers to write and run tests fast, play with their local env, make changes and check them fast. If it\u0026rsquo;s not fast they\u0026rsquo;ll do less iterations, and we\u0026rsquo;ll get to later layers less ready.\nSo in a hypergrowth company, how to maintain fast feedback loop?\nIt should start with observability over the metrics.\nHow much time does it take to run a single test? How much time does it take to spin a new dev env with latest code? How much time does it take to make a code change on dev/staging/production env and see it live? How much time does a pr wait in review on average? Most of the time, when you start, everything is super fast(If you are at the beginning and something is slow, I urge you to stop and optimize), and gradually gets slower and slower, you got chunky modules, more dependencies, files, tooling, scripts and the whole shabang. Keeping things optimal when running fast is almost impossible. At some point you need to stop and think, What feedback cycle is too slow? What can I do about it?\nPossible solution is to have a lab mode where you work in isolation from the entire project, have a thin and lean project that has a shell wrapper that simulates the entire app with stubs.\nAnother one is lot\u0026rsquo;s of separation and decoupling that allows you to work on relatively small parts of the system that can run fast (for example run a test that loads/compiles 15 files of 1 module, instead of all the 3000 files the project need in order to fully run).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your feedback loop time? what are you doing to improve it? please share on comment!\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/the-value-of-fast-feedback-loop/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all wanna get from 0 to 1 (with many trailing zeros), the sooner the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"so-whats-the-problem\"\u003eSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the problem?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou build something and you\u0026rsquo;re brave enough to put it out there, now what?\nNow you start the endless feedback loop cycle, you look at the data, analytics, user recordings, product inputs, and decide what\u0026rsquo;s the next thing that\u0026rsquo;ll make your product better then ever, it\u0026rsquo;s an iterative process that never ends.

Well, there is no one answer for all problems but, I asked it a lot.\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna focus about the view part.\nView objects, AKA view models, but any other name is fine (presenter view object, view controller mediator, whatever).\nWhy do I need it? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s easy, I got a controller action, need to fetch some data from a few places, Data-base, cache, external API, session, and who knows. Next, I need to put this data on a view, the view can be in different formats: HTML, JSON, XML, PDF, whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s the same data, presented in different formats. this data need to go through some manipulations to be more human friendly. What I just described is 80% of apps (web, mobile, desktop) scenarios. Assuming your model is not a read model you can\u0026rsquo;t just fetch one model/list of models and put it on a view. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably have to do some table joins, filters, sorting and a bunch of other things. So first recommendation is to create a query class for each query you need. The controller can call this query directly. Next comes the data manipulation this is where the view model comes to the picture. The view model gets data and make it presentable, Why not putting this logic directly in view. cause views should be stupid as possible, they are not classes, they\u0026rsquo;re hard to debug, so keep them as simple as possible. And if you have multiple views for the same data, like API and a web view, You\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself duplicating logic for each view.\nThere is an issue with directly passing query results to a view model, you are risking with N+1 query performance issues, cause if you pass an active record model to a view model and view model access a referenced object that wasn\u0026rsquo;t pre fetched a DB query will run, If you got a list of 50 models, each with 4 relations not pre-fetched, you got 200 extra queries for a single view, that\u0026rsquo;s not good.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also considered a bad practice to have data queries in the view layer, but that\u0026rsquo;s for another post.\nTo solve this kind of issue you have a few possible solutions,\nDo not pass active record models to the view models, use data transfer objects, plain poro.\nDo not pass active record models to the view models, use :attributes method, relation won\u0026rsquo;t work, but not unexpected queries\nMake sure you prefetch everything the view needs, and pass the model directly to view model, !danger! if other developers work with you, and they don\u0026rsquo;t know the consequences.\nUse a zero relations read model for each view, query it, and send it as is to the view model.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t wanna implement something on you own, here are some gems that\u0026rsquo;ll give you some structure and syntactic sugar:\ndraper - uses the decorator pattern to wrap active record models, allowing to add view specific methods on top of existing models. cells - component based approach to encapsulate view parts, and logic to classes. rom - full blown object mapper dry-view - A component based view framework Personally, I choose to write my own PORO, to keep things as simple as possible, I try to pass data, not models, this way my view models layer is not bound to any data store structure. The query result goes to a view model factory class, that responsible for extracting the relevant data for the view model, and view gets rendered with the view model.\nHere is an example:\nView model -\nmodule ViewModels class GeoMap attr_reader :map_data def map_options { id: \u0026#39;fans-map\u0026#39;, width: \u0026#39;100%\u0026#39;, height: \u0026#39;85%\u0026#39;, label: \u0026#39;Fans\u0026#39;, min_value: 0, colors: %w[#e7f7f0 #19B26C] } end def initialize(map_data, view_context) @map_data = map_data @view_context = view_context end def max_fans @map_data.max_by { |_country, fans| fans }[1] if @map_data.present? end def max_fans_humanize @view_context.number_to_human(max_fans) end def mid_fans_humanize @view_context.number_to_human(max_fans / 2) if max_fans end end end View (Written in slim, using chartkick for the geo map) -\n= geo_chart @geo_map.map_data, @geo_map.map_options Controller -\n# Map data came from a service object @geo_map = GeoMap.new(map_data, view_context) Would love to hear from you, What\u0026rsquo;s your favorite view objects strategy?\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/rails-presentation-objects-guide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you ever used any \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\"\u003eMVC\u003c/a\u003e framework, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you asked yourself more than once, \u0026lsquo;Where should I put this piece of code?\u0026rsquo; (If not that\u0026rsquo;s also fine).\nWell, there is no one answer for all problems but, I asked it a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna focus about the view part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView objects, AKA view models, but any other name is fine (presenter view object, view controller mediator, whatever).\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Rails Presentation Objects"},{"content":"So I found out it\u0026rsquo;s not so documented, hopefully google will index this.

I know that everyone thinks react angular and vue is the s*** but I think its good for large organizations where you have a separate front-end team and back-end team. When you build something new by yourself or with some friends, there is no good reason to start with client side rendering (unless you got a few million users on day one which is less likely)\nThere are also small companies with a team of full stackers, who might also consider this approach.\nIf you got a bit stimulated, you can read a small guide here\n","permalink":"https://kinnrot.github.io/from-jquery-to-stimulus/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI tried to build an \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\"\u003eSPA\u003c/a\u003e without a shiny client side framework, I wanted to build something fast with good user experience and keeping it as simple as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to take \u003ca href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\"\u003erails\u003c/a\u003e, use \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks\"\u003eturbolinks\u003c/a\u003e and a avoid javascript till its a must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take more than a few hours and I found myself writing javascript.

What actually happens in the backstage is whenever you use async/await the method invocation is inserted into a queue that got one worker thread that keep this queue empty. because its just one thread that invoke the methods, it is safe for many threads to use the same object.\nHope its clear enough,\nWanna learn more about async await in ruby? enter you email to get exclusive content!

If you got here, this is what I got so far, it\u0026rsquo;s not too much, but it\u0026rsquo;s a start.\nWhen I develop something my rules are very simple\nAvoid writing any code. Keep it simple. Easy to deploy on free hosting environment. Decent code syntax highlight So I heard(mostly in www) people talking about jekyll as a static web site generator and began to dig dipper, I searched a few ruby gems for blogging and found a gem called [octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress octopress v3). They, the guys who developed it, calls it Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s Ferrari, sounds good to me, looked pretty straight forward so I gave it a spin.\nFirst thing you need to do it to create a new project for your blog (just a new folder)\nmkdir my-blog Next you should create a Gemfile for easy dependency management.\ngem install bundler bundle init Now lets add octopress as a dependency, inside your Gemfile add\ngem \u0026#39;octopress\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;~\u0026gt; 3.0\u0026#39; Now we should tell bundle to install gems from Gemfile, in terminal run\nbundle Everything is set up, now according to [octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress octopress) all we need to do is to run\noctopress init \u0026lt;PATH\u0026gt; and we have a blog ready.\nNow you probably have a blog somewhere, mine is at blogger\nAnd I thought to my self it would be nice to import all my posts to the new blog, well it\u0026rsquo;s super easy, jekyll has many importers read more about it [here](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/ migrations)\nSo after 3 clicks and one script I got all my old posts on my new blog.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Well I need some theme, cause I can\u0026rsquo;t design at all, I just know how to design code, when it comes to colors layout and fonts, I suck.\nI googled a bit and found this and that and chose to start simple with minima, which is minimal and simple to install and work with\nyou just need to add it to your Gemfile\ngem \u0026#39;minima\u0026#39; set the theme property in _config.yaml to minima and you are good to go, by running \u0026lsquo;jekyll build\u0026rsquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see your blog site generated in the _site folder.\nNow we just need to deploy it the easy way, this is where octopress helps. I use github pages, which is very simple to set up, you just need to create a github repo named:\n\u0026lsquo;.github.io\u0026rsquo;\nthen run\nocopress deploy init git \u0026lt;your full repo

of the entered string, now you probably think that the application would get stuck for each key press for at least 200 ms.\nTake a look at the property changed handling:\npublic MainWindow()\n{\n// Sets the buffer time for property changed\nvar interval = 500;\nInitializeComponent();\n// Create observable from the property changed event\nvar propertyChangedObservable = Observable.FromEvent\u0026lt;PropertyChangedEventArgs\u0026gt;(this, \u0026ldquo;PropertyChanged\u0026rdquo;).\nBufferWithTime(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(interval));\n// Define our query from the event, we want to get all fired propertyChanged\nvar query = from changedProps in propertyChangedObservable\nwhere changedProps.Count \u0026gt; 0 select changedProps;\n// start listening\nquery.Subscribe(listOfChangedStuff =\u0026gt;\n{\n// When fired group all events by property name and handle each property with Changed method\nvar events = from distinctEvent in listOfChangedStuff\ngroup distinctEvent by distinctEvent.EventArgs.PropertyName into byPropertyName\nselect byPropertyName;\nforeach (IGrouping\u0026lt;string,IEvent\u0026lt;PropertyChangedEventArgs\u0026gt;\u0026gt; groupedEvent in events)\n{\nChanged(groupedEvent.Key);\n}\n}); }\npublic void Changed(string propertyName)\n{\nif (propertyName == \u0026ldquo;SomeText\u0026rdquo;)\n{\n// Make the properties recalculate themself\nRaisePropertyChanged(\u0026ldquo;CanSplitInMiddle\u0026rdquo;);\nRaisePropertyChanged(\u0026ldquo;CanSplitToThreeParts\u0026rdquo;);\n}\n}\npublic void RaisePropertyChanged(string propertyName)\n{\nvar handlers = PropertyChanged;\nif (handlers != null)\n{\nPropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));\n}\n}\nSo WTF?\nOne of Rx many features is buffer,I can tell property changed event to buffer himself for some time, and when the time passed take all fired events and work with them, what I did is to group all events by the property name (like distinct in sql) and handled each group as a single event.\nSo even if the user is a super turbo writer(or the bot that test the ui) , the event will fired only 2 times in a second, for 500 ms interval.\nI think this is awesome, you can configure the buffer interval according to how complex and time consuming your logic is, and avoid freezing ui.\nI wanted to upload the code to somewhere but o got to

This weekend I learned a new programming language, called coffee script, It's not a real language it's actually compiled to&nbsp;JavaScript, so it's a way to write&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;differently.<div><br /></div><div>After a little hands-on and one <a href="http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/index.html">book</a> read I can say that this is a good language for&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;and non&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;JavaScript programmers.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What's&nbsp;awesome about this&nbsp;language is that is fills like&nbsp;someone&nbsp;took all the good stuff from ruby&nbsp;python&nbsp;and java, and put it in one language that eliminates all the crap you need to take form&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;programming.</div><div><br /></div><div>I can start writing all the good stuff about coffee but there is no need just dive into&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">http://coffeescript.org/</a>&nbsp;and you'll understand all the benefits.</div>

I needed to choose WordPress hosting service for some of clients and decided to do some research to figure out what's best value for each client needs.

There are many service providers in this area, After lots of googling I decided to focus on the following:

1. [WordPress]
2. [BlueHost]
3. [Kinsta]


[WordPress]: https://wordpress.com/create/?aff=9716&cid=958799
[BlueHost]: https://www.bluehost.com/track/kinnrot/ 
[Kinsta]: https://kinsta.com/?utm_source=kinnrot.github.io
[let's encrypt]: https://letsencrypt.org/

WordPress
--------------
If you're building a new site/blog without any technical knowledge, [WordPress] is the right place for you,
owned by the official word press organization offering limited capabilities cheap plans, and more expensive plans with
more options like upload a custom theme, and charging money via paypal.

They also got a free plan, but you won't get to use your own domain name.

BlueHost 
-----------
This is the most economy wise solution.

If you have technical knowledge and you have a custom theme, and wanna save money, this is the service for you, 
It's a managed solution with one click WordPress install. [BlueHost] also offers additional services like seo optimization tool, and backup tool for additional cost.

Kinsta

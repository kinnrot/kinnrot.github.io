<div><div>I'm about to end my first gig(already end! yay I'm free!) as a programmer, and want to leave a clean desk. So here is a list of things I'm doing and suggest you all do before you move to your next gig:<br /><br />1. Write about your major infrastructure developments on your wiki or any other system you got, in an easy to understand language.<br />2. Start lecturing your co-workers about complex parts you developed.<br />3. Make sure you got full code coverage with unit tests.<br />4. Search for to-do comments and make sure you do those todo's.<br />5. If you got unfinished work and think it's worth something make sure someone complete.<br /><br />And the most important: change your phone number :-) (Bazinga).<br /><br /></div></div>

<div><p>Just noticed this method available from API 11 only,&nbsp; so you should find another implementation to avoid unexpected behaviour.</p><p>Or don't call the execute method,&#160; why?&#160; If you'll check documentation you'll see that in some versions of android all tasks will run synchronouslly on the same background thread and on some versions it'll run on a pool of threads. Always use the executeOnExecutor option for consistent behaviour between platform version and avoid unexpected behaviour.</p><p>See <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html">docs</a><br></p></div>

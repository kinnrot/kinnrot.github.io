It took me about an hours and a half because google is not up to date, so here it is:<br /><br />First - as a rails developer, if you don't have node.js, this is the time to <a href="http://nodejs.org/">install</a> it.<br />If you don't use RubyMine as you IDE, I recommend it as well, but whatever you prefer is fine by me.<br /><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/webhelp/preparing-to-use-karma-test-runner.html">Here</a>&nbsp;you'll fins instructions about karma installation, follow them carefully.<br /><br />You'll see that you need to tell karma where is your sources and test sources.<br /><br />I'm working with jasmine, and using angular as a gem, check my configuration:<br /><br />frameworks: ['jasmine'],<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // list of files / patterns to load in the browser<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; files: [<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //libs<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'http://0.0.0.0:3000/assets/application.js',<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="background-color: yellow;">'/Users/chen/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448/gems/angularjs-rails-1.2.9/vendor/assets/javascripts/angular-mocks.js',</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'spec/javascripts/controllers/sample.js',<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'spec/javascripts/controllers/*/*_spec.js.coffee',<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'spec/javascripts/controllers/**/*_spec.js.coffee',<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'spec/javascripts/controllers/**/*_spec.coffee',<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'spec/javascripts/controllers/**/*_spec.js'<br />]<br /><br /><br />To things you should notice:<br />1. I use rails assets pipeline to give all my app code js, (just run your server before you test)<br />2. I add the angular mocks lib<br /><br /><br />All other stuff are basic, I got code in coffee and js so needed a little more lines to find all my tests.<br /><br />this is the way to make this work pretty fast.<br /><br />

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I ran into a guy who worked with me on my previous project.&lt;br /&gt;On that project I was responsible to rewrite the WCF channels (proxies) generation management and lifetime management of them.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do some research and found some good stuff &lt;a href=&#34;http://wcfguidanceforwpf.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;So this guy (aka Kurki) tells me they found a memory leak in my manager, what was the problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i messed up like I always do (well, only 90% of the time, like a good programmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a code that registers to the Faulted event of the channel, kills the channel when Faulted and creates a new one to work with, everything looked fine, only one screw up (I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of you can guess).&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to unregister from the Faulted Event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the web they tell you to do some unique logic to kill your channel in a safe way, what they don&amp;rsquo;t talk about is that it&amp;rsquo;ll stay in memory and fire events if you won&amp;rsquo;t unregister from stuff although you think it is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please &lt;u&gt;do not forget to unregister from stuff even if the object is disposable&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or consider the use of weak event listeners and problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

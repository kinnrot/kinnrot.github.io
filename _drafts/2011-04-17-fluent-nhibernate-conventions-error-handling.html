Tip for the fluent nhibernate users:<br /><br /><u>For mapping conventions</u><br />If your code inside the Apply method throw exceptions (meaning you do more than put comments inside)<br />allways wrap it with try catch block, and write that the exception was throwned there for future maintainablity of your code.<br /><br />It took me 5 minutes to understand where and why I get exception when I added a new entity mapping that didn't follow all other entities conventions.

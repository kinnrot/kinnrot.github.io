Its a very common practice to load data from remote source and display it, there are so many ways of achieving this, The most common pattern I've ran into is:<br /><br />1. ui router initialize a controller<br />2. controller calls some generic loadData method<br />3. loadData calls for remote data that hopefully is in a service<br />4. once data received view data initialized and user see stuff.<br /><br />All of this is working and nice <b>but </b>this is not how the gods of angularjs wanted you to do it.<br /><br />There are so many reasons why not to do it but lets try to keep it simple, so:<br /><br />First thing,<br /><br /><b>The controller should not be responsible for loading the initial data</b><br />The controller should get the data as a dependency, why? all of the component approach really prefer the binding once/one way and it's a pain to bind once to something that does not exists yet (data did not load yet).<br /><br /><b>So who loads the data and when?</b><br />There is a very nice feature called resolve for ui-router. it allows you to define a set of promises that need to return before controller is loaded. when controller initialize it already has the data and can set it on the scope immediately, this way all bindings will work without any issues.
